# Conclusions


Question: How does the model perform out-of-sample (on data that it has never seen before)? Are the predictions as good as, better, or worse than those that were observed for the training dataset?

Answer: The out-of-sample RMSE is lower than the in-sample RMSE. 
RMSE is typically lower for training data, but is higher in this case.

Lower RMSE = better.
